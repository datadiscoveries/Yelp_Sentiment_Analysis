# Yelp Sentiment Analysis


**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this analysis is to tune a neural network model to optimize its accuracy in classifying the sentiment of yelp reviews as positive or negative, based only on the written review. Potential applications in the context of a restaurant business will then be explored.  

**Findings:**<br>
The neural network built in this analysis classifies customer sentiment with 79% accuracy using Yelp reviews. The construction of the model involved a process of adjusting and improving the network architecture. Increasing the number of layers and reducing the number of nodes per layer from their original points improved the model's performance.   


**Applications:**<br>
1. The restaurant can use the model to analyze negative reviews to find specific areas needing improvement (food, service, ambiance, pricing, or specialty meals, etc). Analyzing positive reviews will help the business identify soecific attributes of the restaurant that should be reinforced. 
2. Reputation management personnel can use the model to quickly address the concerns of negative reviewers, and likewise engage with positive reviewers to show appreciation for repeat business. 
3. The model can be used to monitor trends in customer sentiment over time to help the business better understand if specific changes have made a positive or negative impact.
4. Additional yelp data, including ratings and customer sentiment for competing restaurants, can be scraped to offer additional insight from reviewers. The restaurant can then identify specific areas that should be improved to gain a competative edge, learn what customers care about most, and learn sucessful strategies implemented by other restaurants, particularly for competing restaurants. 
5. Explore scraping additional data from other oneline platorms to monitor customer sentiment on a larger scale. Simlilar applications as those above can be used to gain helpful insights with a more robust data set, potentially leading to a more accurate model and additional insights on competing restaurant strategies.
