# Restaurant Customer Sentiment from Yelp Reviews


**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this project is to create a model in Python that accurately categorizes written yelp reviews of a restaurant as "positive" or "negative," without the help of any additional data. The model will use only the words within each review to make the designation. Potential applications of the model will be recommended to help meet the restaurant's business goals.  

**Findings:**<br>
The neural network model built in this analysis designates customer sentiment as positive or negative with **79% accuracy**. The model's performance was found to be improved by increasing the number of _layers in the network_ and reducing the _number of nodes per layer_.   


**Applications:**<br>
1. Stakeholders can use the model to conveniently identify the sentiment of a large number of written reviews to learn how to improve performance and delivery within certain areas (food, service, ambiance, pricing, specialty meals, etc.). It can also be used to conveniently identify which qualities should be reinforced to maintain a positive experience for happy customers. 
2. The model can be utilized by reputation management staff to automate the process of monitoring and reporting the ratio of satisfied to disatisfied customers. This allows concerns from unhappy reviewers to be addressed in a timely manner. Reputation management can also market to happy customers to boost repeat traffic and strengthen the restaurant's reputation. 
3. The model can be used to facilitate automated monitoring of trends in customer sentiment over time to help the business better understand which adjustments have made the most significant impacts in either a favorable or concerning direction.
4. Additional yelp data, including yelp ratings and reviews of competing restaurants, could potentially be obtained and leveraged by the model to offer additional insights. The restaurant can then quickly identify how certain aspects of the business compare with the market standard, learn what customers care about most, and better theorize on effective strategies implemented by similar or competing restaurants.
