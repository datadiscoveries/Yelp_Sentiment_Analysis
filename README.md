# Restaurant Customer Sentiment from Yelp Reviews


**Goal:**<br>
The goal of this analysis is to tune a neural network model to optimize its accuracy in classifying customers' sentiments of a restaurant as positive or negative, based only on written reviews from Yelp reviewers. Potential applications of the model in the context of a restaurant business will then be explored.  

**Findings:**<br>
The neural network built in this analysis classifies customer sentiment with **79% accuracy**. The model's performance was tuned and optimized by increasing the number of _layers in the network_ and reducing the _number of nodes per layer_.   


**Applications:**<br>
1. The restaurant can use the model to analyze negative reviews in finding specific areas needing improvement (food, service, ambiance, pricing, or specialty meals). Reading positive reviews will help the business identify specific attributes of the restaurant that should be reinforced. 
2. Reputation management personnel can use the model to quickly address the concerns of negative reviewers, and likewise engage with positive reviewers to show appreciation for repeat business. 
3. The model can be used to monitor trends in customer sentiment over time to help the business better understand if specific changes have made a positive or negative impact.
4. Additional yelp data, including ratings and customer sentiment of competing restaurants, can be scraped to offer additional insight from reviewers. The restaurant can then identify specific areas that should be improved to gain a competitive edge, learn what customers care about most, and learn successful strategies implemented by other restaurants, particularly for competing restaurants. 
5. Explore scraping additional data from other online platforms to monitor customer sentiment on a larger scale. Similar applications as those above can be used to gain helpful insights with a more robust data set, potentially leading to a more accurate model and additional insights on competing restaurant strategies.
