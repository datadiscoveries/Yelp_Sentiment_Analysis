# Restaurant Customer Sentiment from Yelp Reviews


**Project:**<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a model in Python that accurately designates the sentiment of a restaurant's yelp reviews as positive or negative. Potential applications of the model will be recommended to help meet the restaurant's business goals.  

**Findings:**<br>
The neural network model built designates customer sentiment as positive or negative with **79% accuracy**. The model's performance was tuned and optimized by increasing the number of _layers in the network_ and reducing the _number of nodes per layer_.   


**Applications:**<br>
1. The restaurant can use the model to quickly and conveniently detect and review negative reviews to learn how to improve within certain areas (food, service, ambiance, pricing, specialty meals, etc.). It can also be used to quickly identify and analyze positive reviews to determine which restaurant attributes should be reinforced for customer experience optimization. 
2. Reputation management personnel can use the model to quickly address the concerns of negative reviewers, and likewise engage with positive reviewers to boost repeat traffic and strengthen the restaurant's online presence. 
3. The model can be used to facilitate automated monitoring of trends in customer sentiment over time to help the business better understand which adjustments have made the most significant impacts in either favorable or concerning direction.
4. Additional yelp data, including ratings and customer sentiment of competing restaurants, could potentially be obtained to offer additional insight from reviewers. The restaurant can then identify metrics and areas to improve relative to the competition, learn what customers care about most, and better theorize on effective strategies implemented by similar or competing restaurants.
