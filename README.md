# Yelp Neural Network Sentiment Analysis


Question:<br>
Can we build neural network using Yelp reviews to accurately classify customer sentiment as positive or negative?

Goals and Techniques:<br>
The main goal of this analysis is to determine if a neural network accurately predict customer sentiment based on Yelp reviews. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was used since it can interpret text sequence inputs and temporal information, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot.


Findings:<br>
The neural network built in this analysis classifies customer sentiment with 79% accuracy using Yelp reviews. The construction of the model involved a process of adjusting and improving the network architecture. Increasing the number of layers and reducing the number of nodes per layer from their original points improved the model's performance.   


Recommendations:<br>
1. This analysis recommends utilization of the model to continuously monitor customer sentiment. Sentiment prediction from text allows a potential for additional, faster, and more convenient data collection processes since customers would not necessarily need to leave a numerical rating attached to their written feedback.
2. Consider promoting incentives to entice customers to leave written feedback about the food and service after their experience at the restaurant. Practices associated with the most positive sentiment should be reinforced, and those associated with the most negative sentiment should be improved.
3. Consider exploring the opportunity and feasibility of obtaining additional data from social media and other online outlets to monitor social sentiment more broadly. This would result in access to a more robust dataset, representing the customer base more fully, and potentially lead to more substantiated and accurate insights regarding customer sentiment.
